# DataSetGenerator
Program that generates data sets to test the inside/outside problem at different complexity levels.

The “inside/outside” problem refers to the task in which, given a picture with both a shape as well as a single test point, one must determine whether or not the point lies within that shape.  Valid shapes are allowed to be arbitrarily complex as long as they are closed, and a test point can be located anywhere in the picture that doesn’t intersect the shape’s curve.
